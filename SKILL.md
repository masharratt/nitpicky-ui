# Nitpicky

## Standalone use (no agent, no Claude Code)

The pipeline runs on any folder of findings JSON — from your own scripts, axe-core,
Lighthouse, or another agent:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/masharratt/nitpicky-ui.git
nitpicky init . http://localhost:3000        # scaffold
nitpicky import-axe axe.json --url http://localhost:3000 -o findings/axe.json
nitpicky merge  --run-dir planning/nitpicky/<run-id>
nitpicky review --run-dir planning/nitpicky/<run-id>   # triage portal
nitpicky export --run-dir planning/nitpicky/<run-id>   # CHECKLIST.md
```

Contract for findings producers: `schema/lens-findings.schema.json`.
Tour without any setup: `nitpicky review examples/demo-run`.

## Purpose

Catch the small defects that get normalized during a build: inconsistent verbs,
dead-end states, wordy copy, off-by-pixels polish, missing labels. Parallel agents
walk the whole running app, one concern each, with screenshot proof for every finding.
You triage the merged findings in a local browser page (no server), and the export is
a checklist an implementation team can execute.

This skill spawns agents by design (like cfn-loop-task); the coordinator (you, the
main chat) spawns them. Depth limit exception applies.

## Inputs

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `APP_URL` or `PROJECT_DIR` | arg 1 | Yes | Running app URL, or project dir (find/start the dev server) |
| `--lens a,b,c` | flag | No | Restrict lenses (default: all five) |
| `--skip lens` | flag | No | Run all but this lens (repeatable) |

## Outputs

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `<project>/planning/nitpicky/<run-id>/` | Run dir: `findings/`, `screenshots/`, `run.json`, `findings.json`, `review.html`, `decisions.json` (as you triage), `server.json`, `CHECKLIST.md` (after export) |
| `<run>/findings/<lens>.json` | Per-agent output, exactly per schema |
| `<run>/review.html` | Triage page (findings inlined; served by the portal server) |
| `<run>/decisions.json` | **Authoritative** decision record, written by the server on every click |
| `<run>/server.json` | Portal URL, port, pid, start time — recovery info |
| `<run>/CHECKLIST.md` | Final hand-off checklist (written to disk by the Export button) |

Exit behavior of the coordinator: report run dir + review page path, then stop and
let the user triage. Do not auto-export or auto-implement anything.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the app URL and verify the DATA PATH, not just the landing page.** URL
   given: verify it responds (`curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}'`), then log in
   (test account if needed) and load one real data surface — a list or detail page
   that requires a working backend. Project dir given: detect the dev server
   (package.json scripts, project port references, running port) and start it if
   needed. A landing page 200 with a degraded backend burns the whole run: 45 minutes
   of agents triaging Supabase 503s as app defects. If the data surface fails,
   ABORT and report, or proceed only with the user's explicit say-so and note the
   degradation in every brief.
2. **Scaffold the run.** Optional but recommended: a routes file (one route per line,
   becomes the coverage expectation) and a redactions file (one secret per line —
   test passwords, tokens; merge and export scrub them mechanically):
   ```bash
   RUN_DIR=$("$HOME"/.claude/skills/nitpicky/lib/new-run.sh <project-root> "$APP_URL" \
     [--routes-file routes.txt] [--redact-file secrets.txt])
   ```
3. **Spawn one agent per lens in ONE message** (parallel). Default lenses:
   `consistency`, `friction`, `verbose-language`, `visual-polish`, `accessibility`.
   Agent type: one with Playwright browser access (playwright-tester, or
   general-purpose where MCP browser tools are available). Brief template below,
   keep it under ~2KB.
   - WSL2 RAM: 5 concurrent browser agents fit a 48GB box. On 16GB spawn in two
     waves (3 + 2) and say so in each brief's wave note.
4. **Wait for every completion notification.** Never treat quiet logs or stable
   output files as done.
5. **Merge and validate:**
   ```bash
   python3 "$HOME/.claude/skills/nitpicky/lib/merge-findings.py" --run-dir "$RUN_DIR"
   ```
   Exit 1 (schema/parse errors): re-brief the offending agent for just the repair.
   Exit 0 with repairable output — act on the named warnings before opening the page:
   - `missing-screenshots=[...]`: re-brief that agent to re-shoot the proofs.
   - `duplicate-evidence: lenses=... ids=[...]`: byte-identical screenshots across
     lens prefixes = shared-browser contamination; re-brief those agents to re-shoot
     in their OWN browser context.
   - `uncovered-expected=[...]`: routes from coverage.expected no lens covered;
     re-brief ONE agent for just the holes.
   - `run-health: suspected-env=N` (+ WARNING when high): backend likely degraded —
     say so when handing the page to the user; the portal has a filter for those
     findings.
   Exit 2: agent produced nothing — re-run that lens.
   Cross-lens near-duplicates are clustered automatically (`Likely duplicate` line in
   the portal with an apply-to-cluster button); do not re-brief for them.
6. **Start the portal server and open the page:**
   ```bash
   nohup python3 "$HOME/.claude/skills/nitpicky/lib/server.py" \
     --run-dir "$RUN_DIR" --port 0 > "$RUN_DIR/server.log" 2>&1 &
   sleep 1
   cat "$RUN_DIR/server.json"   # url, port, pid — verify the server is alive
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$RUN_DIR/server.json'))['url'])")"
   "$HOME"/.claude/skills/nitpicky/lib/open-site.sh "<url from server.json>"
   ```
   Launch it detached and VERIFY it survives the launching command (a server that
   dies between assistant turns is the #1 failure mode of this portal pattern —
   the user sees "Not saved" and their pending edits sit only in the page).
   Tell the user: every click writes `decisions.json` on disk; unsaved edits are
   kept in the browser and a Retry button appears if the server drops; filter
   chips narrow the list; "Next undecided" walks the queue; Bulk actions applies
   one decision to the whole filtered set (with confirm); likely cross-lens
   duplicates show an apply-to-cluster button; suspected-environment findings are
   filterable; Export writes CHECKLIST.md straight into the run dir; **Submit to
   agent** wakes you when they want the results acted on (see Submit-to-agent flow).
7. **Arm the submit watcher** before walking away, so a Submit click wakes you:
   ```bash
   # background task; its completion notification is the wake-up
   bash "$HOME/.claude/skills/nitpicky/lib/submit-watcher.sh" --once "$RUN_DIR"
   ```
   When it completes: `GET /api/submit/status` or read `submissions.jsonl`, run
   `nitpicky export --run-dir "$RUN_DIR"`, summarize what the user decided, and ask
   before implementing anything. Then re-arm the watcher for the next round
   (partial submits are normal: each Submit hands over only new-or-changed decisions).
7. **Hand-off.** When the user finishes triage (or asks mid-review), Export has
   written `$RUN_DIR/CHECKLIST.md`. Read `decisions.json` (or `GET /api/decisions`)
   to act on decisions yourself. Never parse CHECKLIST.md as the decision source;
   the JSON is authoritative. Keep explanations verbatim; a deny with an
   explanation may authorize an alternative change — do not collapse it to "no work".

### Submit-to-agent flow

`decisions.json` is the durable record; the Submit button is the *signal*. The
portal diffs every decision against per-finding fingerprints
(`submit-state.json`): **only new-or-changed decisions are submitted** — unchanged
ones are skipped, so repeated clicks never re-ping the agent for the same content.
Each click appends an event line to `submissions.jsonl`.

Session-side wake-up options:

| Mechanism | Command | Behavior |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Background task (default) | `submit-watcher.sh --once <run-dir>` | exits on first new submission; the completion notification wakes the session; re-arm after handling |
| Monitor-style | `submit-watcher.sh --follow <run-dir>` | emits one event per Submit, runs for the session |

No watcher armed? Submit still records state and events; the user can fall back to
Export, or the next session reads `GET /api/submit/status` to see what is pending.

Default on wake: export + summarize + ask. Auto-implementing fix decisions without
the user in the loop is not nitpicky's behavior.

## Recovery runbook (user reports "Not saved")

1. Read `$RUN_DIR/server.json` for the pid/port; check the process: `ps -p <pid>`,
   `tail "$RUN_DIR/server.log"`.
2. Restart on the SAME port (`--port <from server.json>`), detached, log appended.
3. Tell the user to click **Retry save** in the still-open page — do NOT tell them
   to refresh first; pending edits live in the page and drafts survive in browser
   storage keyed by run id (restored automatically after a reload too).
4. Verify convergence: `decisions.json` gains the missing records.

### Server rules

- One server per run dir. Never two processes on the same `decisions.json`; the
  server caches state in memory and would overwrite external edits.
- Do not hand-edit `decisions.json` while the server runs. Stop it first, or POST
  a correction to `/api/decision`.
- A malformed `decisions.json` makes the server refuse to start (exit 2) rather
  than clobber it — fix the file by hand, then restart.

## Agent brief template

```text
Nitpicky walkthrough. Lens: <lens>.

Read these two files FIRST; they are your full contract:
- $HOME/.claude/skills/nitpicky/lib/lenses.md
- $HOME/.claude/skills/nitpicky/lib/findings-schema.md

App under review: <APP_URL>
Screenshots dir: <RUN_DIR>/screenshots/
Write findings to: <RUN_DIR>/findings/<lens>.json

BROWSER ISOLATION (mandatory): launch your OWN isolated browser context — your own
Playwright instance or a fresh incognito context. Never use a shared MCP browser
tab; parallel agents collide there and contaminate each other's evidence.

Summary: this app is being prepared for launch and human testing. Walk the ENTIRE
app through your lens only. Extreme detail and thoroughness are the job: every page,
every state, every small defect. Expected finding volume for a real app is high; do
not stop early. Every finding needs a screenshot saved into the screenshots dir
named <lens>-<short-slug>.png and referenced as "screenshots/<file>.png". Report
your walked/blocked/skipped routes in the coverage block, and mark findings
`suspected_env_cause: true` when the failure looks server-side. Output JSON only,
at that path, exactly per schema. No code fixes, no architecture notes.

[LIVE-TARGET STANZA — include this block only when APP_URL is not localhost:]
LIVE TARGET: this is a production system with real users and real data. Read-only
walk. NEVER: purchases or payments; deleting or modifying real records; sending
emails/messages/notifications; security setting changes (2FA, passwords); external
service or bot invocations; AI generation that burns credits; exporting real
customer data. Test only with data you created (test-named) and only reversible
actions; otherwise record a coverage `skipped` entry with the reason.

You are a leaf agent. Do not spawn subagents; do the work yourself.
```

## Resume / re-run

- Decisions persist in the browser's storage keyed by run id. Re-opening
  `review.html` restores them. Same-browser, same-machine persistence only.
- Re-running one lens later: agent rewrites `findings/<lens>.json`, re-run merge.
  Finding ids are content hashes (lens + what), so unchanged findings keep their ids
  and saved decisions still line up. Editing a finding's `what` text changes its id.
- Multiple runs never collide: storage key includes the run id.

## Dependencies

- python3 (stdlib only), bash 4+
- Playwright browser access inside walkthrough agents (MCP tools or project playwright)
- wslview or explorer.exe for auto-open (optional; path printed as fallback)

## Known limitations

- Loopback bind (127.0.0.1) is not authentication: single local reviewer, private
  local files. Never host a run dir publicly.
- Findings are inlined into review.html at merge time; re-run merge after any
  agent output change before reviewing.
- The page still opens from file:// as a fallback (browser storage + manual
  downloads), but the server path is the primary workflow — file mode keeps no
  disk record of decisions until you export.
- Finding ids change if an agent rewrites a finding's `what` text; treat re-run
  decisions as fresh for changed findings.
- Walkthrough agents judge what a browser session can see. Server-rendered states
  behind auth need a test account; seed one before the run if the app requires login,
  and pass credentials in the brief (redact them from the exported checklist).

## Version History

- **1.6.0** (2026-09-14): Cross-run decision memory. Export/submit records
  decided findings (fix/defer/deny + notes) per app in
  `planning/nitpicky/memory.json`; later runs match findings against it
  (route + token overlap) and annotate them `memory`; the portal hides
  previously denied/deferred findings by default behind a show toggle.
- **1.5.0** (2026-09-14): Submit-to-agent. Submit button on the portal hands only
  new-or-changed decisions to the reviewing session (fingerprint diff in
  `submit-state.json`, events in `submissions.jsonl`); `lib/submit-watcher.sh`
  wakes the session (`--once` background task or `--follow` stream). `GET
  /api/submit/status` reports pending count. Default wake behavior: export +
  summarize + ask.
- **1.4.0** (2026-09-13): Standalone release. `nitpicky` CLI (init/merge/review/
  export), published findings JSON Schema, axe-core + Lighthouse adapters,
  examples/demo-run, packaging (pipx-installable). Implementation packaged under
  `src/nitpicky/`; `lib/` scripts kept as shims for skill-path compatibility.
- **1.3.0** (2026-09-13): First live-run feedback incorporated (172-finding run):
  mandatory per-agent browser isolation + mechanical duplicate-evidence detection;
  data-path pre-flight; coverage manifest (coverage.expected + per-agent coverage
  block + uncovered-expected report); cross-lens duplicate clustering with
  apply-to-cluster in the portal; live-target safety stanza for non-localhost
  targets; mechanical credential redaction (run.json redactions scrubbed at merge
  AND export); run-health summary; portal env-cause filter; bulk actions on the
  filtered set.
- **1.1.0** (2026-09-12): Decision portal server. Decisions write to
  `decisions.json` on disk per click (atomic tmp+rename, validated patches,
  origin-checked). Browser draft queue survives server outages (Retry button);
  export writes CHECKLIST.md directly into the run dir. Aligned with hardening
  lessons from a prior decision-portal implementation.
- **1.0.0** (2026-09-12): Initial release. Five lenses, per-lens agents, static
  triage page with autosaved decisions, checklist export.
